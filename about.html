By nearly any measure, Pranathi Hospital is a world leader in the field of Medication. But it’s not the size of our staff, the number of offices, or even our surgical volumes of which we are most proud. Instead, we base our success on two things: are we improving our patients’ lives and are they satisfied with our service and care. Achieving these goals requires an unwavering commitment to quality. <br><br>

As the healthcare industry continues its move from a volume-based system to one based on value, Pranathi Hospital has established and maintained a leadership position. For years, we have collected, studied and published our outcomes. We invest millions of dollars per year into our research enterprise. And we continuously ask our patients how we are performing and whether they are satisfied with the care they receive.<br><br>

The days where we measured quality by “gut feelings” are over. Today, we use data to objectively measure everything from post-surgical infections to patient satisfaction. This collection of facts allows us to identify problems early, make corrections and improve care. Our data-centric approach has been and will continue to be a top priority for our practice.<br><br>
